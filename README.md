# HousePricing
This project uses a dataset of different houses sold in the USA to predict the price of houses based on a given set of features using a Linear Regression model (code in Python).

***** House Pricing Project *****

This project uses the kaggle dataset available at ttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata?resource=download  to predict the price of houses based on a given set of features using a Linear Regression model.


The project is divided in 5 main parts:

1) Dataset Characterization - were we explore the dataset and observe its characteristics, like the size and the existing features

2) Data Preprocessing -	were we check the consistency of our data, feature engineer new variables from the existing ones and manage the categorical variables so that they can be used in the model

3) Exploratory Data Analysis - were we do some visualizations to understand the prices distribution and also how some features correlate and influence the prices. A litle more data processing is done in this step to solve some issues that the visualizations allow us to find

4) Predictive Model - were we built a Linear Regression Model to predict the Houses' prices using a K-Fold Cross-Validation Scheme and try different features combinations to create the best model possible with the existing data

5) Conclusion - were we interpret the obtained results and do some considerations on how to improve the price prediction results


To build this project it was used Python along with some of its libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn, and the Google Colab notebook. Feel free to contact me through my linkedin page if you have any question.
